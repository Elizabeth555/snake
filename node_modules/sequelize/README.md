Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js/io.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

[Documentation](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## Installation

`npm install sequelize`

From 3.0.0 and up Sequelize will follow SEMVER. 3.0.0 contains important security fixes so we highly recommend that users upgrade.

If you still use 1.7 please prefer to [Upgrading to 2.0](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/Upgrading-to-2.0) and the changelog between 2.0 and 3.0. 2.1 also has a breaking change.
