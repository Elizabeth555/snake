# About

  Generic resource pool.  Can be used to reuse or throttle expensive resources such as
  database connections.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  
## 2.0 Release Warning

The 2.0.0 release removed support for variable argument callbacks.  When you acquire
a resource from the pool, your callback *must* accept two arguments: (err, obj)

Previously this library attempted to determine the arity of the callback, but this resulted
in a variety of issues.  This change eliminates these issues, and makes the acquire callback
parameter order consistent with the factory.create callback.

## Example

### Step 1 - Create pool using a factory object

```js
// Create a MySQL connection pool with
// a max of 10 connections, a min of 2, and a 30 second max idle time
<<<<<<< HEAD
var Pool = require('generic-pool').Pool;
var mysql = require('mysql'); // v2.10.x

var pool = new Pool({
    name     : 'mysql',
    create   : function(callback) {
        var c = mysql.createConnection({
                user: 'scott',
                password: 'tiger',
                database:'mydb'
        })

        // parameter order: err, resource
=======
var poolModule = require('generic-pool');
var pool = poolModule.Pool({
    name     : 'mysql',
    create   : function(callback) {
        var Client = require('mysql').Client;
        var c = new Client();
        c.user     = 'scott';
        c.password = 'tiger';
        c.database = 'mydb';
        c.connect();
        
        // parameter order: err, resource
        // new in 1.0.6
>>>>>>> master
        callback(null, c);
    },
    destroy  : function(client) { client.end(); },
    max      : 10,
    // optional. if you set this, make sure to drain() (see step 3)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    min      : 2,
    // specifies how long a resource can stay idle in pool before being removed
    idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,
     // if true, logs via console.log - can also be a function
    log : true
=======
    min      : 2, 
    // specifies how long a resource can stay idle in pool before being removed
    idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,
     // if true, logs via console.log - can also be a function
    log : true 
>>>>>>> master
});
```

### Step 2 - Use pool in your code to acquire/release resources

```js
// acquire connection - callback function is called
// once a resource becomes available
pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
    if (err) {
        // handle error - this is generally the err from your
<<<<<<< HEAD
        // factory.create function
=======
        // factory.create function  
>>>>>>> master
    }
    else {
        client.query("select * from foo", [], function() {
            // return object back to pool
            pool.release(client);
        });
    }
});
```

### Step 3 - Drain pool during shutdown (optional)
<<<<<<< HEAD

If you are shutting down a long-lived process, you may notice
that node fails to exit for 30 seconds or so.  This is a side
effect of the idleTimeoutMillis behavior -- the pool has a
setTimeout() call registered that is in the event loop queue, so
node won't terminate until all resources have timed out, and the pool
stops trying to manage them.

This behavior will be more problematic when you set factory.min > 0,
as the pool will never become empty, and the setTimeout calls will
never end.

In these cases, use the pool.drain() function.  This sets the pool
into a "draining" state which will gracefully wait until all

});
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

If you do this, your node process will exit gracefully.

## Documentation

    Pool() accepts an object with these slots:

                  name : name of pool (string, optional)
                create : function that returns a new resource
                           should call callback() with the created resource
               destroy : function that accepts a resource and destroys it
                   max : maximum number of resources to create at any given time
                         optional (default=1)
                   min : minimum number of resources to keep in pool at any given time
<<<<<<< HEAD
                         if this is set >= max, the pool will silently set the min
                         to factory.max - 1 (Note: min==max case is expected to change in v3 release)
=======
                         if this is set > max, the pool will silently set the min

>>>>>>> master
                         optional (default=0)
           refreshIdle : boolean that specifies whether idle resources at or below the min threshold
                         should be destroyed/re-created.  optional (default=true)
     idleTimeoutMillis : max milliseconds a resource can go unused before it should be destroyed
                         (default 30000)
    reapIntervalMillis : frequency to check for idle resources (default 1000),
          returnToHead : boolean, if true the most recently released resources will be the first to be allocated.
                         This in effect turns the pool's behaviour from a queue into a stack. optional (default false)
         priorityRange : int between 1 and x - if set, borrowers can specify their
                         relative priority in the queue if no resources are available.
                         see example.  (default 1)
              validate : function that accepts a pooled resource and returns true if the resource
                         is OK to use, or false if the object is invalid.  Invalid objects will be destroyed.
<<<<<<< HEAD
                         This function is called in acquire() before returning a resource from the pool.
                         Optional.  Default function always returns true.
         validateAsync : Asynchronous validate function. Receives a callback function as its second argument,
                         which should be called with a single boolean argument being true if the item is still
                         valid and false if it should be removed from the pool. Called before item is acquired
                         from pool. Default is undefined. Only one of validate/validateAsync may be specified

                   log : true/false or function -
                           If a log is a function, it will be called with two parameters:
                                                    - log string
                                                    - log level ('verbose', 'info', 'warn', 'error')
                           Else if log is true, verbose log info will be sent to console.log()
                           Else internal log messages be ignored (this is the default)

specifies the caller's relative position in the queue.

 var pool = poolModule.Pool({
>>>>>>> master
     name     : 'mysql',
     create   : function(callback) {
         // do something
     },

     destroy  : function(client) {

     destroy  : function(client) {

         // cleanup.  omitted for this example
     },
     max      : 10,
     idleTimeoutMillis : 30000,
     priorityRange : 3
 });

 // acquire connection - no priority - will go at front of line (same as high priority)
 pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
     pool.release(client);
 });

 // acquire connection - high priority - will go into front slot
 pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
     pool.release(client);
 }, 0);

 // acquire connection - medium priority - will go into middle slot
 pool.acquire(function(err, client) {
     pool.release(client);
 }, 1);

 // etc..
```

## Draining

If you know would like to terminate all the resources in your pool before
their timeouts have been reached, you can use `destroyAllNow()` in conjunction
with `drain()`:

```js
pool.drain(function() {
    pool.destroyAllNow();
});
```

One side-effect of calling `drain()` is that subsequent calls to `acquire()`
will throw an Error.

## Pooled function decoration

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
To transparently handle object acquisition for a function, 
>>>>>>> master
one can use `pooled()`:

```js
var privateFn, publicFn;
publicFn = pool.pooled(privateFn = function(client, arg, cb) {
    // Do something with the client and arg. Client is auto-released when cb is called
    cb(null, arg);
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
Keeping both private and public versions of each function allows for pooled 
>>>>>>> master
functions to call other pooled functions with the same member. This is a handy
pattern for database transactions:

```js
var privateTop, privateBottom, publicTop, publicBottom;
publicBottom = pool.pooled(privateBottom = function(client, arg, cb) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    //Use client, assumed auto-release
=======
    //Use client, assumed auto-release 
>>>>>>> master
});

publicTop = pool.pooled(privateTop = function(client, cb) {
    // e.g., open a database transaction
    privateBottom(client, "arg", function(err, retVal) {
        if(err) { return cb(err); }
        // e.g., close a transaction
        cb();
    });
});
```

## Pool info

The following functions will let you get information about the pool:

```js
// returns factory.name for this pool
pool.getName()

// returns number of resources in the pool regardless of
// whether they are free or in use
pool.getPoolSize()

// returns number of unused resources in the pool
pool.availableObjectsCount()

// returns number of callers waiting to acquire a resource
pool.waitingClientsCount()
<<<<<<< HEAD

// returns number of maxixmum number of resources allowed by ppol
pool.getMaxPoolSize()

// returns number of minimum number of resources allowed by ppol
pool.getMinPoolSize()

=======
>>>>>>> master
```

## Run Tests

    $ npm install expresso
<<<<<<< HEAD
    $ npm test

The test runner runs every test in parallel, so tests cannot safely share
resources. If a test fails, its thrown assertion error may bubble up and halt
execution/cause failures in other running tests; these are spurious. If you
have a failing test, try running it in isolation until you get it to pass.

The individual tests "wait" by repeatedly checking the condition in the
`beforeExit` callback. The test is marked as "passed" if the `beforeExit`
callback runs successfully. Generally, this is accomplished by counting the
number of assertions and checking that all of the test's assertions have been
asserted.

## Linting

We use eslint and the `standard` ruleset. At the moment linting is not done as part of the test suite but this will probably change in the future. You should ideally lint your code before making any PR's patches etc.

Becuase the linting tools require nodejs >= `0.10` but we test against `0.8` and `0.6` installation of the tools is done via `npm run lint-install`. Some kind of optionalDevDependencies would be great!

    $ npm run lint-install
    $ npm run lint
